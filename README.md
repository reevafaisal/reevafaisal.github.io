## Projects
Computer Vision | [github_repository](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ffcce0d-8a95-4333-ada5-b8607b42b549) | 06/2023  
Worked in a team of 2 to build an image processing app that stores images in code and implements some image processing methods in a Processor Template. Uses inheritance to simulate a monetized app and to simulate a premium app with new methods. Implements a KNN classifier to predict the labels of images. Personally, built a UI to optimize user experience and track image processing costs.
