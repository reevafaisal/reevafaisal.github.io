## Projects
Hazel - Tutorial Systems | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/hazelgrove/hazel/pull/1330) | [PR](https://github.com/hazelgrove/hazel/pull/1330) | 07/2024 â€“ present
Hazel is a live functional programming environment that is able to typecheck, manipulate, and even run incomplete programs, i.e. programs with holes. My current project involves creating and adding a new tutorial mode functionality to Hazel for new users to adapt to functional programming environment. (PI: Cyrus Omar, Assistant Professor).

Image Processing App | [Website](https://reevafaisal.pythonanywhere.com/) | [ReadMe](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ffcce0d-8a95-4333-ada5-b8607b42b549) | 06/2023  
Collaborated in a team of two to design and implement an image processing application. Leveraged object-oriented programming and inheritance to simulate a monetized structure, enabling premium features for advanced image processing tasks for the original class project. Integrated a KNN classifier for image label prediction. Voluntarily developed both a GUI and a CLI to enhance user interaction, streamline processing workflows, and track image processing costs, optimizing user experience across multiple interfaces.
