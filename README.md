## Projects
Hazel - Tutorial Systems | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/hazelgrove/hazel/pull/1330) | [PR](https://github.com/hazelgrove/hazel/pull/1330) | 07/2024 â€“ present  
My current project involves creating and adding a new tutorial mode functionality to Hazel for new users to adapt to the interface. I am working with editor states and ensuring that new users can interact with and receive feedback for their code to familiarize themselves with the syntax and functionality of the programming environment. (PI: Cyrus Omar, Assistant Professor).

DIY Hazelnut | [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/reevafaisal/diyHazelnut) | 06/2024  
An implementation of Hazelnut: A Bidirectionally Typed Structure Editor Calculus. Implemented core features of Hazelnut in Reason (OCaml), focusing on bidirectional type synthesis and cursor erasure for functional expressions. Developed key modules for handling higher-order types, expressions, and their cursors, ensuring accurate type compatibility. The building of a hazelnut expression and its type synthesis can be viewed by using the webapp.

Image Processing App | [Website](https://reevafaisal.pythonanywhere.com/) | [ReadMe](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ffcce0d-8a95-4333-ada5-b8607b42b549) | 06/2023  
Collaborated in a team of two to design and implement an image processing application. Leveraged object-oriented programming and inheritance to simulate a monetized structure, enabling premium features for advanced image processing tasks for the original class project. Integrated a KNN classifier for image label prediction. Voluntarily developed both a GUI and a CLI to enhance user interaction, streamline processing workflows, and track image processing costs, optimizing user experience across multiple interfaces.
